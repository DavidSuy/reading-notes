# Open-Source Software Contribution

## Summary

There are numerous benefits when a developer contributes to an open-source software. Contributing to OSS allows developers to practice their programming skills and gain feedback from experienced programmers. Gaining early experience prior to applying for an internship can help secure a position at a reputable tech company and accelerate your career. Recognition from the OSS community members helps developers to improve their skills and open up opportunities such as job offers. Developers will also have greater job prospects because OSS is visible to the public and employers are able to assess their skills. Most of the time, developers come across OSS as users first and desire to contribute to the OSS for their own use. The result is a mutually beneficial situation since the business receives a new feature that can be used by other users and the developer is able to practice their skills.
