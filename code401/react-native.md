   Expo aims to enhance React Native and provide all the JavaScript APIs you need for the most common needs.

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the expo workflow.

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?

   When you eject from the managed workflow, the app becomes a vanilla React Native app that includes all the Expo SDK APIs that you were using.

2. When should you not eject?

   Once you eject expo, you can't inject it back. So, all the great development experience that you had with expo is gone now.

3. Why might you choose to eject?

   When your expo project needs a native module that expo doesn't currently support
