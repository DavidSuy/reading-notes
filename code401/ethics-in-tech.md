# Readings: Ethics in Tech

## Readings

### Summary

The code I’m still ashamed of:

As a developer myself, I will be sure to think twice about the effects of my code before I write it, especially if ever assigned to work on a project similar to the one Bill Sourour had written code for in this article. I agree that as developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices. Bill coded for a website that was designed to trick young girls into taking a particular drug, which had side effects of severe depression and suicidal thoughts, and he felt wrong for it. A young girl who was taking the drug died of suicide, which resulted in Bill eventually resigning. Later, more people who were taking the drug that Bill had built a website for were experiencing severe depression or passed away by suicide, and I do not blame Bill for never feeling okay about writing that code because he did not have bad intentions as he was simply just doing his job.

Self driving car ethics:

Self driving cars may reduce accidents, but they will not eliminate them altogether. It will be difficult to replicate the thousands of years of moral, ethical, religious, and social behaviors programmed into human beings into a self-driving vehicle. Aside from philosophical considerations, some argue that these scenarios are unrealistic. I disagree as there are many scenarios to think about when considering the tough ethical circumstances self-driving cars may encounter. In a no-win situation, there may not be a good answer to who should die if it is to be judged by a human.
