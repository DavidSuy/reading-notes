# Linked Lists

A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property

linked list consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

### Compared to Arrays

### List

- do not have indexes
- connected via nodes with a next pointer
- random access is not allowed

### Arrays

- indexed in order
- insertion and deletion con be expensive
- can quickly be accessed at a specific index
